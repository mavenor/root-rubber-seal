# root-rubber-seal
An assignment for school — in Java — to explore merkle trees, and their application in checking data integrity.

<sup>If you’re here looking for a way to hash/get-the-checksum-of directories, you should check out my C++ library [*“sealdir”*](https://github.com/mavenor/sealdir), which is also based on **Merkle trees**</sup>
